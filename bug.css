This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with custom directives.  The problem arises when the custom directive contains a property that's also present in the base Tailwind CSS styles. The `@apply` directive might incorrectly override the intended styles from the custom directive with the base Tailwind styles, resulting in unexpected visual outcomes. For example, if you define a custom directive `@layer utilities{ @define-directive my-custom-style { @apply bg-gray-200 p-4;  } }`,  and later apply it using `@apply my-custom-style`, and Tailwind has a default styling for `p-4` that conflicts, then the custom `p-4` might be overridden.
